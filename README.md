# Spam Message Detector Model 

Let's create a spam detector to that employees get only relevant messages/email and it filters out all irrelevant/spam messages.

The model should be able to guage whether it is a *spam* or an *ham* message.

### About the data
### 

* Our IT Team has already scraped all the messages in an excel file for us.
* The files contain one message per line.
* Each line is composed of different message.

### About this file
### 

The e-mail Spam Collection is a set of e-mails tagged messages that have been collected for e-mail Spam research. It contains one set of e-mails messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged according being *ham* (legitimate) or *spam*.
Through these message we can easily train our model for better prediction of the ham messages and properly detect the spam message which is not so much useful for us.
